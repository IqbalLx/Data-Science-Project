# Data-Science-Project
A collection of my personal Data Science Project to enhance my skills for EDA, FE, Data Cleaning and Predictive Modeling

- `Egg_producing_Chiken - EDA_Visualize.ipynb` - The main objective of this dataset is to know better what factor that mostly affects the number of eggs produced for each day. You can find my story from this **Egg Producing Chikens project in my** [**personal web space**](https://www.iqbalmaulana.space/2020/05/egg-producing-chickens-dataset.html)

- `Titanic_Dataset - EDA_and_Modeling.ipynb` - The main objective to explore this dataset is to predict whether the passenger going to survived to not at that accident given the features available. You can find my story from this **Titanic dataset project in my** [**personal web space**](https://www.iqbalmaulana.space/2020/05/titanic-dataset-eda20.html)

- `Analisa_Pendapatan (TA_SanberCode_DS_Bootcamp).ipynb` - The main objective to do with this dataset is to predict people's salary given the dependent variables. You can find my story from this **Predicting Salary Project in my** [**personal web space**](https://www.iqbalmaulana.space/2020/05/exploring-and-modeling-salary-dataset.html)

> As I grow my knowledge in Data Science, this repo will keep update with my upcoming projects. Check out my Personal Web Space too at https://iqbalmaulana.space
